* [Node fs docs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) - specifically the methods `readFile` and `writeFile`
* [Node path docs](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) - specifically the methods `join`

* Checkout `mkdirp` and `rimraf` on `npm`

## Description:

You library:

* `make-db.js`
  * function that takes a root directory and returns an instance of a `Db` class
  * `Db` - class that takes a root directory in constructor and has a `createStore` method that 
  takes the name of the type of objects in the Store and returns
  an instance of a `Store` class (Store is like a Table)
 
  ```js
  // inside createStore:   
  return new Store(path.join(this.rootDir, storeName));
  ```
  
* `store.js`
  * class that takes a directory that it should use and manages object of "store". It has the methods listed below
  
 
```js
const makeDb = require('../lib/make-db');
const db = makeDb('./name-of-directory');
const cats = db.createStore('cats');
const buildings = db.createStore('buildings');
```

The store offers `save`, `get`, `getAll`, and `remove` methods.

Use json as a file format to store (serialized and deserialized) javascript objects.

**You are strongly encouraged to pair on this assignment**

## Testing

You should use TDD to drive the implementation. 

The setup for the test can be difficult as we want to ensure the tests start with a "clean" file directory 
**(hint: this is where `rimraf` will come in handy)** 
You will want to read about [Mocha's before/after hooks](https://mochajs.org/#hooks)

Your tests will need to handle asynchronous calls.  You will need to read about [Mocha and async support](https://mochajs.org/#asynchronous-code)

## Requirements/Guidelines

For today, your db should offer the following methods:

* `.save(<objectToSave>, callback)`
  * creates a `_id` property for the object
  * saves the object in a file, where the filename is the `_id`. e.g. if the id is 12345, the file will be 12345.json
  * returns `objectToSave` with added `_id` property
* `.get(<id>, callback)`
  * returns the object from the requested table that has that id
  * return `null` if that id does not exist
* `.getAll(callback)`
  * returns array of all objects from the requested table
  * return empty array `[]` when no objects
* `.remove(<id>, callback)`
  * removes the object
  * return `{ removed: true }` or `{ removed: false }`


Here is an example of how your module might be imported (required) and used:

```js

const makeDb = require('../lib/make-db');
const db = makeDb(path.join(__dirname, 'data'));
const animals = db.createStore('animals');

animals.save({ name: 'garfield' }, (err, cat) => {
  
    if(err) return console.log('ERROR', err);
    
    const id = cat._id;
    
    animals.get(id, (err, cat) => {
      if(err) return console.log('ERROR', err);
      console.log('got cat', cat);
    } 
});

animals.getAll((err, animals) => {
  if(err) return console.log('ERROR', err);
  console.log('we have', animals.length, 'animals');
});
```

Make sure to test:

* Two types of "objects" (e.g. "animals" vs "stores")
* Two different id's of same object type.

* Use `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` to move from javascript object to file representation
